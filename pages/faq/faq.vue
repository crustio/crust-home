At the same time, Crust's architecture also can provide support for a decentralized computing layer to build a distributed cloud ecosystem.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decentralized storage allows files to be stored on different hosts by distributing the files across the entire network without being restricted by any centralized entity. Users can flexibly manage their data and effectively enhance data security and reliability through data encryption, secure backup, authorized access and other means. At the same time, the storage space sharing model can also effectively reduce storage costs. In 2019, Gartner, the world's leading research and advisory company, announced the Top 10 strategic technology trends for 2020, which shows that distributed cloud service and practical blockchain technology are among the top ten technology development directions in 2020. Crust is exactly the overlap and extension of these two areas.`,

          title_en:
            "What are the main differences between Crust and Filecoin, a star project in the storage field?",
          content_en: `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is about the difference in complexity and cost. To be more detailed, the incentive for storage providers is a key issue in the field of decentralized storage. A fair incentive mechanism must be that the more storage provided and the greater the contribution, the more rewards can be obtained. So the question turns into how to make the blockchain accurately reach a consensus on the volume of storage provided by each node, and by so to reward those who perform storage normally and punish those who perform storage improperly, such as those who delete user files without permission. Further, the key issue of storage incentives has evolved: how storage nodes prove their storage capabilities. An important difference between Filecoin and Crust lies in the way of proof of storage. The storage capacity of Filecoin requires each node to periodically provide proof to the network. This proof is calculated by the node through a zero-knowledge proof based on the file it stores. However, since the Crust node supports the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology, it can check the file locally on the node and periodically generates a workload report signed by the TEE. Crust's local inspection method does not need to introduce the complex zero-knowledge proof, which reduces computational costs and lowers thresholds. At the same time, compared to the periodic report generated by zero-knowledge proof, Crust's workload report is much smaller, which decreases the occupation of network resources. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is the difference between incentive mechanisms. Filecoin's current incentive mechanism for storage nodes is based on the number of storage orders accepted by the node, while Crust's incentive is based on the storage space or capability provided and the collateral obtained by the node, which is what we call staking. Crust's incentive for storage nodes is independent of the storage market, which is conducive to the growth of storage resources during the cold start period. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the difference in the consensus of producing blocks. Filecoin is using an EC (Expected Consensus) algorithm based on VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and VDF (Verifiable Delay Function), while Crust is based on GPoS, a PoS consensus where storage resources are used as guaranty quota. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the difference between Crust and Filecoin is also reflected in the support for computing. Crust's trusted resource monitoring module, in addition to monitoring and quantifying storage resources, also can monitor and quantify computing resources. The second-tier computing consensus module and integration for cloud computing applications are also included in Crust's future plans.`,
          content:
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;首先是复杂性和成本的差别。对存储提供者的激励是去中心化存储领域中的关键问题。公平的激励机制一定是存储量提供的越多，贡献越大，则能获得越多的奖励。所以问题就转化为，如何让区块链准确的对每个节点提供的存储量达成共识，奖励正常存储的人，处罚存储不当的人比如擅自删除用户文件的人。进一步的，存储激励的关键问题就演变成为：存储节点如何证明自己的存储量。Filecoin与Crust的一个重要差别，在于存储量的证明方式上。Filecoin的存储量需要每个节点周期性的向网络提供一个证明，这个证明是节点根据它存储的文件通过零知识证明计算得到的。而Crust节点通过支持可信执行环境技术（Trusted Execution Environment，简称TEE），在节点本地对文件进行检查并周期性的生成一个TEE签署的工作量报告。Crust的本地检查方式无需引入复杂的零知识证明，降低了计算开销和门槛，同时相比于零知识证明生成的周期性报告，Crust的工作量报告更小，降低了网络资源的占用。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;其次，是激励机制的区别。Filecoin目前对存储节点的激励基于节点接的存储订单，而Crust的激励则是基于提供的存储空间，以及节点获得的抵押也就是我们说的Staking。Crust对存储节点的激励，是独立于存储市场之外的，这样有利于冷启动时期存储资源的增长。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;然后还有出块共识的区别。Filecoin是基于VRF（可验证随机函数）以及VDF（可验证延迟函数）的EC（预期共识）算法，而Crust基于以存储资源做担保额度的PoS共识，GPoS。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;最后，Crust和Filecoin差别还体现在对计算的支持。Crust的可信资源监控模块，除了可以监控和量化存储资源外，同时也有能力监控和量化计算资源。二层的计算共识模块以及面向云计算应用的集成也在Crust未来的计划内。",

It is a secure area on the main processor, which can guarantee the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the code and data loaded into the internal environment. TEE provides an isolated execution environment. The security features provided include isolated execution, the integrity of trusted applications, the confidentiality of trusted data, and secure storage. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Crust, when each node enters the network, the entire network needs to verify the identity of its TEE. It is determined that it is a valid TEE, and then remote authentication is performed to determine that the validation logic is executed in the TEE. Then this TEE is equivalent to the node's monitor, which periodically checks the working status of the check node and generates a working report. Other nodes can reach a consensus on the storage space by verifying the TEE signature of the work report.`,

            " What are the consensus mechanism and economic model design of Crust?",
          content_en: `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crust is using the GPoS (Guaranteed Proof of Stake) consensus, which is called PoS consensus with storage resources as a guaranty quota. The storage resources mainly refer to meaningful data stored and empty disks available.Similar to existing PoS projects, nodes need to stake CRU tokens to compete for the right to generate blocks. The difference is that nodes also need to provide storage resources to obtain the corresponding guaranty quota. With the guaranty quota, the corresponding number of CRUs can be staked.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this mechanism, two types of assets, storage resources, and CRU tokens are must conditions to become nodes. By combining the advantages of resource-based (such as Bitcoin) and token-based (such as Cosmos) consensus mechanisms, network security can be more effectively protected from malicious deeds. If Crust network consensus is under attack, in addition to requiring a large percentage of CRU tokens, you also need to be able to control a sufficient amount of storage resources. This design makes the attack very difficult.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The node also allows the guarantor to use the CRU as a guarantee on the premise that it owns the storage resources as a guarantee. That is, the node-staked CRU can be it's own or from a guarantor. When the guarantor chooses to guarantee the node, it allows guarantors to obtain benefits, but also requires them to bear the risk of the node being punished. If a node is confiscated by the system for triggering a penalty mechanism, the guarantor will also be fined at a certain rate since it serves as a guarantor. Under this mechanism, the guarantor will tend to choose a node with good faith and good service to guarantee it, and the market will decide a balance between the guaranteed income and the risk of punishment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a network protocol for underlying data storage, Crust provides the function of storing resource transactions. CRU tokens are used as the contract security deposit in this trading market to ensure the order of the trading market.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, similar to other blockchain projects, CRU tokens will also be served as transaction fees for using the network, which is much similar to Gas in Ethereum. It can also be used directly to purchase resource services in the network.`,

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crust网络使用的是GPoS（Guaranteed Proof of Stake）共识，称为以存储资源做担保额度的PoS共识。这里的存储资源包括以MPoW机制量化的有意义数据存储，以及可用的存储空间。和现有的PoS项目类似，节点需要将CRU通证Stake来竞争生成区块的权利，不一样的是节点还需要提供存储资源以获取相应的担保额度，有了担保额度才能Stake相应数量的CRU。在这个机制下需要有存储资源和CRU通证两类资产才可以成为节点，将资源型（如比特币）和通证型（如Cosmos）共识机制的优点结合起来，更有效的保证网络安全性。如果想从共识上攻击Crust网络，除了需要拥有大比例的CRU通证，还需要能控制足量的存储资源，这样的设计会让攻击难度变得非常高。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;节点在拥有存储资源担保的前提下，还可以寻求担保人使用CRU为其担保。即节点Stake的CRU可以是自有的也可以是来自担保人。担保人选择为节点担保，除了可以获得收益外，也需要承担节点被处罚的风险。如果节点因为触发了处罚机制被系统罚没资产，担保人也要按所担保比例被罚没。在这个机制下，担保人会倾向选择诚信的、服务质量好的节点而为其担保，在担保收入和处罚风险之间由市场决定出一个平衡。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;作为一个底层数据存储的网络协议，Crust提供了存储资源交易的功能，CRU通证在这个交易市场中作为交易合约的保障金来保障交易市场次序。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;最后，和其它区块链项目类似，CRU通证还会作为使用网络的交易费，类似以太坊中的Gas。它也可以直接用于购买网络中的资源服务。关于GPoS的更多细节可以参考《Crust经济设计白皮书》。",
